# Reaktor pre-assignment submission
This is my take on [Reaktor's pre-assignment for junior dev positions](https://www.reaktor.com/junior-dev-assignment/).

You can see it in action at https://reaktor-assignment.eelinki.now.sh

## Information
This was built using React.js.
The raw `/var/lib/dpkg/status` file is processed mostly using regex, after which it is displayed neatly in cleanly formatted page with clickable links to the packages.

## How to
Start a development server
```
npm install
npm start
```

To build a production build
```
npm run build
```
